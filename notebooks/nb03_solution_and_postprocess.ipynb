    "Having solved the problem of assembly of the global equilibrium equations for the full finite element mesh we are now ready to find the unknown nodal displacements. We won't be dealing directly with solvers but will use Python's linear algebra modules. With the nodal displacements available we will be ready to compute secondary variables (e.g., stresses and strains).In this Notebook we will also use most of the available subroutines of the finite element code **SolidsPy** (Gomez and Guarin-Zapata, 2018). Most of these subroutines follow the same structure of the implementations conducted so far. **After completing this notebook you should be able to:**\n",
